gri (2.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Permit `rewind' to take a filename. 
    - Make `open' set `\.return_value.' to the full pathname of the file
      that was opened. 
    - Add `set path' command.
    - Remove functioning of `GRIINPUTS' environment variable, since this
      is more cleanly handled with the newly added `set path to' command.

    - Change the format of images in the PostScript output file, as a
      workaround for a bug in the `ps2pdf' program.

      look up the name and nesting level of changeable arguments.
    - Add ``at-sign'' (`@') syntax for aliases.
    - Add ability to embed newlines in `show' commands with the `\<<' sequence.
    - Add ability to embed TAB characters in `show' commands with the
      `\>>'sequence.

      arguments. 
    - Add automatic support for gzipped compressed data files.

    - Reorganize parts of manual (e.g. changing the section about the

    - Improve the HTML form of the manual (e.g. color-code the Gri syntax
      in examples, provide access to all the indices, use PNG format, etc.). 
    - Numerous gri-mode.el enhancements (including new pull-down menu
      listing all Gri commands).
  * Use debhelper.

gri (2.4.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. ** Bug Fixes Only; No new features **
    - Remove bug in which `convert grid to image' produced incorrect
      images, visible as a patchy appearance with coarse grids.
    - Remove bug in which `convert image to grid' failed to take note of
      the gri minimum and maximum, so that contouring of the grid was not
      possible for grids created from images.
