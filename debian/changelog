    - Reorganize parts of manual (e.g. changing the section about the 
      Emacs `gri-mode.el' into a chapter, with screenshots). 
    - Improve the HTML form of the manual (e.g. color-code the Gri syntax
      in examples, provide access to all the indices, use PNG format, etc.). 
    - Numerous gri-mode.el enhancements (including new pull-down menu
      listing all Gri commands).
  * Use debhelper.
  * Info files have .info suffix now.
  * gri-html-doc suggests doc-base (otherwise it's not registered).  
  * gri.emacsen-remove: delete ${destination}/gri-mode.CompilationLog.gz
  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.5.2 with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS variable
    (Default build no longer complies with debugging symbols, -g)

gri (2.4.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. ** Bug Fixes Only; No new features **
    - Remove bug in which `convert grid to image' produced incorrect
      images, visible as a patchy appearance with coarse grids.
    - Remove bug in which `convert image to grid' failed to take note of
      the gri minimum and maximum, so that contouring of the grid was not
      possible for grids created from images.
