       example images are now in Jpeg format instead of Gif.
    (2.5.2) Numerous gri-mode.el enhancements (including new pull-down menu).
    (2.5.1) Add two new RPN operators, `file_exists' and `directory_exists'.
    (2.4.4) Issue warning instead of fatal error when attempting math
       ops on empty data columns.
  * Use debhelper.
  * Info files have .info suffix now.

gri (2.4.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. ** Bug Fixes Only; No new features **
    - Remove bug in which `convert grid to image' produced incorrect
      images, visible as a patchy appearance with coarse grids.
    - Remove bug in which `convert image to grid' failed to take note of
      the gri minimum and maximum, so that contouring of the grid was not
      possible for grids created from images.
