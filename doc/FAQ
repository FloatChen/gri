     _________________________________________________________________
   
A1 Features

   [36]
   
  A1.1 What is Gri?
  
   Gri is a program for drawing scientific graphs. It makes xy plots
   (linegraphs and scattergraphs), contour plots, and image plots. Unlike
   many scientific plotting packages, Gri provides precise control over
   fonts, line widths, grayscales, colors, etc. Since Gri was written by
   a scientist, it does the kinds of plots scientists want. It has few
   frills; e.g., it does not do 3D mesh plots, because the author
   dislikes them. Gri is command-driven, not mouse driven.
   
   [37]
   
  A1.2 What does `Gri' stand for? How is it pronounced?
  
   Gri stands for `gr-interactive', and `gr' is the name of a subroutine
   library that preceded Gri. The `interactive' adjective indicates that
   Gri can be used interactively -- that is, Gri is an interpreted
   language whereas Gr is a compiled language. `Gri' rhymes with `try'.
   
   [38]
   
  A1.3 What does Gri cost?
  
   Gri is free. A commercial version, called [39]Gre (rhymes with `tree')
   will be made available in late 1997 or early 1998. It contains most of
   Gri as a subset, but also contains quite a lot of the Perl language as
   well, so that it is a fully functional (and efficient) interpreted
   programming language.
   
   [40]
   
  A1.4 How long will it take to learn Gri?
  
   Most users can get Gri working after spending half an hour with manual
   (see [41]Q2.1). Familiarity with your operating system (for example
   for viewing PostScript files) will speed this somewhat. After that,
   it's best to learn new features only as you come to need them. To
   begin with, you should skim the manual and the cookbook (see
   [42]Q2.3), looking just at the illustrations. This will take no more
   than an hour.
   
   The Gri manual is like most computer manuals: it would be a waste of
   time to read it cover to cover before starting to use Gri. But you'll
   find the manual helpful as you branch out, modifying the existing
   examples and inventing code of your own.
   
   Learning how to use a new command usually takes only a minute but
   realizing that the command exists can take longer. That's why many
   users with sophisticated needs find it useful to spend an afternoon
   leafing through the entire manual at some point.
   
   Most things in Gri can be done elegantly or crudely. The elegant
   approach may require a little investment in time at the beginning, but
   this will pay off constantly as your needs grow. For example, folks
   who like computer programming often start using Gri "newcommands" (a
   form of subroutines) within a few days. Other folks might avoid
   newcommands, instead putting their entire program in one long "main
   routine". What's right for you depends on how you think and the sort
   of work you do.

A2 Documentation

   [43]
   
  A2.1 Is there a quick-reference card for Gri?
  
   Yes, two quick-reference cards are stored on the [44]FTP site
   ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri (the base address is
   129.173.3.50). The PostScript file refcard.ps is an overview of Gri
   syntax and usage, while cmdrefcard.ps is a full list of Gri commands.
   Each of these files is also available in TeX format.
   
   [45]
   
  A2.2 Where can I get documentation for Gri?
  
   Full documentation is available in several forms on the FTP site
   [46]FTP site ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri (the base
   address is 129.173.3.50). Check out the FAQ file (which you are
   reading now), cmdrefcard.ps (a PostScript reference card listing all
   Gri commands), refcard.ps (a PostScript reference card overviewing
   Gri), and a file called something like gri_manual_2.051.tar.gz (which
   is a complete PostScript manual including figures). To save time and
   paper, you should look at the FAQ and the two reference cards first.
   
   The Gri manual is available on the WWW (world wide web) at the URL
   [47]http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/~kelley/gri/gri1.html . A searchable
   index is available there, which is very useful. [48]
   
  A2.3 Is there a cookbook of Gri programs to use for guidance?
  
   Yes, at the website
   [49]http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/~kelley/gri/cookbook/cookbook.html 
   
   [50]
   
  A2.4 Is there a newsgroup for Gri?
  
   No, but there is a mail-list type newsgroup. The group is maintained
   automatically by a program called majordomo. Operations like getting
   on or off the list are done by mailing to
   [51]majordomo@phys.ocean.dal.ca; to subscribe, send a message
   containing just the two words subscribe gri, and to unsubscribe send
   the words unsubscribe gri. You can also send the message help to find
   out other usefull majordomo commands.
   
   To see what messages have been posted to the group, send a message to
   [52]majordomo@phys.ocean.dal.ca containing the line send gri
   gri.archive.
   
   Mailing to the list -- that is, to other Gri users -- is different.
   Then you mail to [53]gri@phys.ocean.dal.ca. There is not very much
   traffic on the list, but please use it responsibly because everything
   you send will be mailed to dozens of other folks who are just as busy
   as you are. In particular please do not mail any requests intended for
   majordomo to the Gri list.
   
   [54]
   
  A2.5 Where can I get some sample Gri input files?
  
   You can get them from the anonymous [55]FTP site
   ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri (the base address is
   129.173.3.50). It is in the compressed tarfile with the word 'example'
   contained in it. The file is compressed with the program "gzip," so
   you'll type

        gunzip gri-examples-2.1.10.tar.gz
        tar xvf  gri-examples-2.1.10.tar

   (where 2.1.10 will be changed to the current version number), and the
   tar program will create a directory called 'examples' which contains
   the example .gri programs and datafiles. The 'examples' directory also
   contains subdirectories with names that reflect computer names (e.g.,
   SGI, SUN4). To get run gri on all the examples, go into the
   appropriate subdirectory and type 'make examples'. For example:

        cd examples/SUN4
        make examples

   creates files examples/SUN4/example1.ps, examples/SUN4/example2.ps,
   etc.

A3 Can Gri do ... ?

   [56]
   
  A3.1 Can Gri do barcharts?
  
   Gri has no specific command for barcharts, but the operating system
   can easily rearrange your data into a form that lets Gri draw
   barcharts. In the following example, the synonym \width is set to the
   desired width of the bars and \missing is set to an arbitrary missing
   value. The rest of the code will make sense to any Perl programmer. If
   you don't know Perl, you should learn it.

\width = "1"                    // width of bars, in x units
\missing = "-99"                // missing value
set missing value \missing
set x axis 0 6 1
set y axis 0 20 10
draw axes none                  // will get whited out by the chart anyway

// Create dataset
system cat > barchart.dat << "EOF"
1 12
2 14
3 15
4 13
5 10
EOF

// Create barchart style dataset and plot it
system perl <<"EOF"
open (IN, "barchart.dat") || die "Cannot open barchart.dat";
while(<IN>) {
    ($x[$i], $y[$i]) = split(' ');
    $i++;
}
$n = $i;
open (TMP, ">tmp") || die "Cannot open tmp";
for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {
    print TMP $x[$i] - \width / 2, " ",      0, "\n";
    print TMP $x[$i] - \width / 2, " ", $y[$i], "\n";
    print TMP $x[$i] + \width / 2, " ", $y[$i], "\n";
    print TMP $x[$i] + \width / 2, " ",      0, "\n";
    print TMP \missing, " ", \missing, "\n";
}
EOF
open tmp
read columns x y
set graylevel 0.95
draw curve filled to 0 y
set graylevel 0
draw curve
draw axes
draw title "Demonstrate Gri barchart"

   [57]
   
  A3.2 Can Gri do histograms?
  
   Gri has no specific command for histograms, but the operating system
   can easily rearrange your data into a histogram format.
   
   Here is Gri code to do it:
open "histogram -l 0 -h 10 -i 0.5 < inputfile |"
read columns x y // y is number of obs
draw curve filled to 0 y

   where histogram is a perlscript which creates a histogram file named
   inputfile. An example of histogram is:

#!/opt/bin/perl
# Calculate histogram of 1-column data
$usage ="\
NAME\
     histogram -- create histogram file, given data file (1 column)\
\
SYNOPSIS\
     histogram -l low -h high -i increment < input_file > output_file\
\
DESCRIPTION\
     Scans the input values and finds the percentage of data in bins\
     starting at value `low', ending at value `high', and incrementing by\
     value `inc'.\
\
FILES\
     Standard input:  column of numbers\
     Standard output: columns: (bin_centre, per, cum_per, num, cum_num)\
         where 'per'=percentage and 'num'=number.\
";
require "getopts.pl";
$opt_l = 0;
$opt_h = 0;
$opt_i = 0;
&Getopts('l:h:i:');
die "You must supply commandline arguments!\n$usage" if ($opt_l == $opt_h || $o
pt_i == 0);
$n = ($opt_h - $opt_l) / $opt_i;
print STDERR "Will have $n bins, running from $opt_l to $opt_h in steps of $opt
_i\n";
for ($i = 0; $i <= $n; $i++) {
    $bin[$i] = 0;
}
while(<>) {
    chop;
    ($x) = split;
    $i = int(0.5 + ($x - $opt_l) / $opt_i);
    $i =  0 if ($i < 0);
    $i = $n if ($i > $n);
    $bin[$i]++;
}
for ($i = 0; $i <= $n; $i++) {
    $x = $opt_l + $opt_i * ($i - 0.5);
    print "$x $bin[$i]\n";
    $x = $opt_l + $opt_i * ($i + 0.5);
    print "$x $bin[$i]\n";
}

   [58]
   
  A3.3 Can Gri do error bars?
  
   Gri has no specific command for error bars. It has no internal
   representation of error bar data -- that is, you can't get them by a
   read columns command. However, you can get error bars quite easily,
   simply by reading the data line by line, plotting each one as
   individually. Here's an example of error bars in y, where the third
   column stores the error:

open a.dat
while 1
    read .x. .y. .ey.
    if ..eof..
        break
    end if
    draw symbol bullet at .x. .y.
    draw line from .x. {rpn .y. .ey. -} to .x. {rpn .y. .ey. +}
end while

   [59]
   
  A3.4 Can Gri draw labels for Tukey box plots?
  
   Yes. Here is sample code, in which a label "My Label" is drawn to the
   right of the median of a Tukey plot extending in the y direction:

read columns x y
1 11
2 22
1.2 3
3 5
2 20
3 10

draw y box plot at 2
draw label "My Label" at {rpn 2 xusertocm 0.4 +} \
    {rpn y median yusertocm "M" ascent 2 / -} \
    cm

   [60]
   
  A3.5 Can Gri read compressed data files?
  
   Gri has no specific way to read compressed data files, but it is
   trivial to trick it to do so, by using the unix-style piped open
   command, as in this example:

open "zcat compressed_file.Z |"
// do any normal 'read' commands

   Naturally, this works for files that have been compressed with the GNU
   compressor also, so long as you have the uncompressing software
   installed on your system.
   
   [61]
   
  A3.6 Can Gri use scientific notation on axes?
  
   You have to trick it. Here's an example:
// NOTE: this requires manual setting of axes.
read columns x y
1 1.1e3
2 1.0e3
3 1.4e3
4 2.3e3
4 1.0e4

y /= 1e3
set y axis 1 5 1
set y format "%g$\times10^3$"
draw curve

   [62]
   
  A3.7 Can Gri label x-axis with day of week?
  
   A future version of Gri will have much more powerful and general ways
   of handling axes labelling. In the meantime, you have to trick Gri to
   get such special effects. Here's an example:

set x axis 1 8 1
set y axis 0 1 .1
set font size 0
draw x axis at top
draw y axis at right
draw x axis at bottom
set font size 12
draw y axis at left
draw label "Mon" centered at 1.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Tue" centered at 2.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Wed" centered at 3.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Thu" centered at 4.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Fri" centered at 5.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Sat" centered at 6.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}
draw label "Sun" centered at 7.5 {rpn ..ymargin.. 0.7 - ycmtouser}

   Note that the offset of 0.7 centimeters looks OK to me, with a 12
   point font, but you may wish to experiment if you don't like the
   placement.
   
   [63]
   
  A3.8 Can Gri draw maps?
  
   Gri can draw maps, but it only has a couple of projections: the
   cartesian "projection" (it is not really a projection), the
   stereopolar projection, and the Peters projection (see the command set
   map projection). It does not have builtin coastline files, though.
   Many good coastline files are on the web; see, for example, Rich
   Signell's site [64]http://crusty.er.usgs.gov/coast/getcoast.html or
   the USGS mapping site [65]http://www.usgs.gov or the Global
   Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline site
   [66]http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html

A4 Gri and other programs

   [67]
   
  A4.1 Is Gri better than Fortran/C/... plotting subroutines?
  
   Gri started out as a set of subroutines. The set is called `gr'; the
   name `gri' means gr-interactive. Although I wrote both `gr' and `gri',
   I haven't used gr in years. I am unaware of anybody else who ever used
   `gr'. Thus, in at least this case, the interpreted Gri language is
   superior to subroutines.
   
   In some applications the graphics are hard-wired into the computation
   so using Gri might not make sense. An example is the SPEM numerical
   model, which has builtin NCAR plotting calls. But this approach is
   inefficient in user-time and computer-time, because changing the
   format of the output may require re-running a model. The best approach
   is to decouple preparation of data from presentation of data.
   
   In highly interactive applications, such as many uses of matlab and
   statistical programs such as S and S-plus, it may make sense to use
   the builtin graphics routines because they are so tightly bound to the
   processing. [68]
   
  A4.2 How can I include Gri plots in LaTeX files?
  
   This is done outside LaTeX (or TeX), with the program that converts
   from DVI format to PostScript format. This conversion is done
   differently on different computers; you'll have to enquire locally.
   With `dvips', you can use the `\special' command or the `\espfbox'
   command. The epsfbox command is smarter, since it figures the plot
   dimensions from the PostScript file itself. Unfortunately, old
   versions of Gri do not insert the correct plot dimensions in the
   PostScript file. Here's an example, for a 15cm tall figure, of how to
   insert a Gri PostScript file into a figure:

\documentstyle{article}
\begin{document}

... Figure \ref{fig1} shows ...

\begin{figure}
\vspace*{15cm}                  % MAKE ENOUGH SPACE
\special{psfile=fig1.ps}        % THIS INSERTS THE PLOT
\caption[Short caption, which appears in list of figures.]
{\label{fig1} Long caption, which appears with the figure.}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

   In other LaTeX and TeX dialects, of course (e.g. the lovely agu++
   format), you'll do things differently; the above will give you enough
   of a guide.
   
   [69]
   
  A4.3 How may I convert Gri output to GIF format?
  
   Conversion of the Gri PostScript output to GIF is normally done for
   inclusion in web-pages. For a discussion of the merits of various
   image formats, see [70]Information Architecture. I have been told that
   GIF images suffer from both technical limitations (no gamma value is
   stored in the file) and license restrictions. The PNG format was
   designed to overcome these limitations, and is expected to replace GIF
   before the year 2000.
   
   It should also be noted that there is no generally acceptable way to
   convert PostScript to gif, especially when the PostScript is vector
   based. One problem is that of resolution: if the output GIF is
   low-resolution, then the text may be drawn roughly because of
   rasterization. In many convertors one may specify the size of the
   output image, which permits control over this resolution problem,
   giving the user the task of weighing file size against output quality.
   Note also that the colour table frequently gets reordered in the
   conversion, possibly leading to inaccurate results. Simply stated,
   PostScript is superior to GIF and other raster-based formats. That's
   why Gri chose PostScript for the output model.
   
   There are several ways to convert Gri PostScript into GIF images.
     * METHOD 1. Use the convert program, which is a part of the
       ImageMagick set of software. The convert software is quite
       powerful, being able to convert from almost any format into almost
       any other. The ImageMagick software is free, and available on the
       world-wide-web at URL
       [71]http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html 
     * METHOD 2: The GNU program gs can also do this conversion. In newer
       versions, this conversion to GIF is builtin. Here is a shellscript

#!/usr/bin/sh
gri -y -p -b $1.gri
gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=ppm -sOutputFile=$1.ppm $1.ps -c quit
ppmtogif -interlace -transparent rgb:ff/ff/ff $1.ppm > $1.gif
rm -f $1.ppm
     * METHOD 3: In older versions of gs, you must run a little program
       in the gs interpreter, by typing

    $ gs foo.ps
    GS> (pstoppm.ps)run
    GS> (foo) ppm1run
    GS> quit
       This creates a file called foo.ppm, in the so-called PPM format.
       To convert this to GIF format, you may use the xv image viewer
       program (which is licensed shareware, not freeware), or use the
       ppmtogif program in the pbmplus package, available on the web at
       [72]ftp://ftp.x.org/congrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz .
       
   Availability of software: ImageMagick uses Aladdin Ghostscript,
   another free program, to rasterize the PostScript file created by gri.
   Ghostscript is available from
   [73]http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html and many other sites
   (including any CTAN archive). Older version of ghostscript are
   available under the GNU GPL. Speaking of GNU, gs and other GNU
   software are freely available at many locations on the web, e.g.
   [74]ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu .
   
   Author's note: this answer was compiled with advice from Peter
   Galbraith, Toru Suzuki, and George White, to each of whom I am very
   grateful for the help. In fact, the answer is mostly a patchwork of
   their suggestions, and all the helpful pointers to information on the
   web are theirs, not mine.
   
   [75]
   
  A4.4 Is there an Emacs mode for Gri?
  
   Yes. Peter Galbraith has written a very powerful mode for Gri
   commandfiles. Available on anonymous FTP at the site
   [76]ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca in users/rhogee . See the files gri-mode.el
   and gri-mode.readme. The capabilities include:
     * Indents the loops, if statements, newcommands, etc.
     * Uses builtin knowledge of Gri commands to 'complete' your
       commands. For example, typing 'drM-TAB' (where M-TAB is the
       completion keystroke) causes the mode to write 'draw' in place of
       the 'dr'. Pressing M-TAB again gives a list of all Gri commands
       starting with 'draw'.
     * Provides complete access to Gri help on commands, including the
       full Gri 'info' manual if your machine has that installed. There
       is even an 'apropos' feature to let you search for commands you're
       not sure even exist.

A5 Evolution of Gri

   [77]
   
  A5.1 Where can I get the latest version of Gri?
  
   To get Gri, you use anonymous FTP to the site [78]site
   ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca or 129.173.3.50. (Use 'anonymous' as the
   username and your normal username as the password.) Next, go to the
   Gri directory:

        cd users/kelley/gri

   and get the instruction files:
        mget README.*

   These files tell you what to do next. If you are not familiar with
   such things, you might want to exit from FTP and read the README
   files. Otherwise, just do a directory listing and pick up the item you
   want. For example, to get the Sun binary version, get the file with
   the word ``Sun'' in it:

        binary
        get gri-binary-SunOS5-2.1.10.tar.gz

   and then type
        quit

   to get out of FTP, and
        zcat gri-binary-SunOS5-2.1.10.tar.gz | gar xvf -

   to decode the contents.
   
   [79]
   
  A5.2 How can I find out the most recent features of Gri?
  
   Do anonymous ftp to phys.ocean.dal.ca (129.173.3.50) and cd to the
   directory /users/kelley/gri. Pick up the file ChangeLog. For more
   details, see the chapter called "History" in the [80]manual. [81]
   
  A5.3 Should I keep my copy of Gri up-to-date?
  
   The advantages of being up-do-date are:
     * You get new features.
     * There is a better chance of getting your bugs repaired, since all
       bug fixes are applied only to the current version.) The
       disadvantages of being up-to-date are:
     * You can get clobbered by new bugs. (You should avoid this by
       keeping your old versions of Gri. That means archiving both gri,
       the executable, and gri.cmd, the startup file.)
     * You can get clobbered by changes in the syntax. This is the
       penalty you pay for using a program under active development. To
       protect yourself, use the expecting version command, which will
       warn you of any incompatibilites between the version you expect
       and the version that is presently installed.
       
   Most people should not be more than 5-10 versions out of date. To keep
   in touch, subscribe to the gri maillist (...see [82]Q2.3). Also, keep
   track of the file ChangeLog in the FTP location. As with most
   software, the supplier may be more enthusiastic about new versions
   than the users are. Other Gri users may therefore provide the best
   advice on whether it is worth upgrading.
   
   Every time you get a new copy of Gri, you should get a new online
   manual, and you should get/print the command reference card from the
   [83]FTP site ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri (the base
   address is 129.173.3.50).
   
   [84]
   
  A5.4 How can I protect myself against changes to Gri?
  
   Do three things:
     * Use the expecting version .n. command, where you replace .n. by
       the version number you are familiar with. Then if the Gri you are
       using is more recent, it will tell you of any changes in syntax
       since the version you've named.
     * When you download a new version of Gri, look at the file called
       'changelog' in the [85]FTP site
       ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri (the base address is
       129.173.3.50). It tells you what changes have taken place.
     * Archive old versions. Each version takes about a Megabyte, which
       costs less than a cup of coffee. Since the author does not archive
       old versions, you would be a little crazy not to do it yourself,
       if you use Gri much at all.
       Archiving the source is just a matter of copying the files you've
       downloaded to a location of your choosing.
       Archiving the binary is easy, since the process of installing a
       new version automatically archives the old version. On my machine,
       and on other machines in the default configuration, the Gri files
       are contained in a directory named /opt/gri. Within the /opt/gri
       directory are directories named bin, which stores (a link to) the
       executable gri file, and lib, which stores (links to) the library
       file gri.cmd and the startup message file startup.msg. These links
       point to files within other directories within /opt/gri,
       directories whose names are Gri version numbers. For example, if a
       system contained version 2.051 as the main Gri and 2.044 as an
       archived version, /opt/gri would contain directories named bin,
       lib, 2.051, and 2.044.
       Each time a new version of Gri is installed, the remaining version
       is left on disk, with the links in /opt/gri/bin and /opt/gri/lib
       being severed and then reconnected to the newer versions. Thus, on
       my system I can run version 2.051 just by typing

    gri
       or I can run version 2.044 by explicitly naming it's source and
       the directory for the library files, e.g. by typing.

    /opt/gri/2.044/bin/gri -directory /opt/gri/2.044/lib
       On my system links are also created to put Gri in the system path,
       e.g.

    /opt/bin/bin/gri -> /opt/bin/bin/gri-2.048*
       and some users find it convenient to save typing with the old Gri
       versions, by making additional links such as

    /opt/bin/bin/gri-2.042 -> /opt/gri/2.042/bin/gri*
    /opt/bin/bin/gri-2.043 -> /opt/gri/2.043/bin/gri*
    /opt/bin/bin/gri-2.048 -> /opt/gri/2.048/bin/gri*
       Also, the emacs mode understands about using different versions;
       see the C-c C-r or by calling the command M-x gri-version

A6 Gri on various computers

   [86]
   
  A6.1 What computers does Gri work on?
  
   Gri has been ported to several Unix machines (e.g. Sun solaris and
   sunOS; IBM RISC; HP RISC; SGI; DEC alpha; and x86 linux) and to x86
   MS-DOS. An old version is available for DEC vax VMS.
   
   [87]
   
  A6.2 What kind of compiler is required to compile gri?
  
   Gri requires a C++ compiler capable of handling the language feature
   called "templates," and it also needs the so-called "standard template
   library" (STL). Templates have been a feature of C++ since about 1994,
   and STL became part of the draft C++ library standard in early 1996.
   If your compiler vendor does not support templates or STL, you should
   obtain a newer compiler.
   
   The free C++ compiler called g++, available from the Free Software
   Foundation, is known to compile Gri on at least a half-dozen problems.
   The compiler version must be 2.7.2 or higher for success.
   
   [88]
   
  A6.3 Why can't I link my compiled gri? (on HP computer)
  
   Unfortunately, I made a bad programming decision several versions ago
   -- I decided to start using the STL (the standard template library).
   The STL is part of the draft ANSI C++ standard, so I figured I'd be
   safe. And my tests on solaris and linux platforms indicated that STL
   worked as advertised, in g++ 2.7.x. However, I should have checked
   further. It turns out that g++ on some platforms (e.g. HP's unix and
   IBMRS's AIX unix) does not handle templates properly. The linker
   cannot locate templates defined in one file and used in another. This
   issue is discussed at some length in the g++ documentation, where
   three methods are presented for solving the problem. (In the
   info-format documentation, you can find the relevant parts by
   searching for the string "where's the template?") In Gri I've used
   what method 3 as defined in the g++ manual. Apparently this fails on
   some platforms. Although I'd welcome tests by users on the other two
   g++ methods, and I'd be happy to switch if one of them appeared to
   work more universally, I have to say that I'm not optimistic: from
   what I read on the newsgroups, nobody is having much success on this.
   The GNU folks say that g++ version 2.8 will handle templates much
   better, so I'm waiting for that. Unfortunately it's been, so far, a
   two-year wait.
   
   Almost certainly, commercial compilers handle templates better, but I
   lack resources to purchase these for the various platforms. I'd be
   happy, though, to act as a broker for anyone who is able to compile
   Gri on the problematic platforms, and who is willing to share their
   results.
   
   [89]
   
  A6.4 Is there a Macintosh version of Gri?
  
   There once was a clicky-pointy Macintosh version of gri, but I got
   frustrated with modifying the code each time Apple upgraded the OS and
   stopped maintaining the code. After several years of living (happily)
   without the Macintosh, I flushed the Mac code down the drain.
   
   However a version for Macintosh unix is [90]available.
   
   [91]
   
  A6.5 Is there a DOS/Windows version of Gri?
  
   There is a version available for DOS, available at the normal Gri FTP
   site, [92]ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri, and copy
   another at the anonymous FTP site
   [93]ftp://shiho.tokyo-u-fish.ac.jp/pub/msdos/gri with filename of the
   form gri2025b.zip where 2025 refers to the version name. This binary
   version was prepared and very kindly shared by Toru Suzuki
   [94]toru@shiho.tokyo-u-fish.ac.jp. Together with the distribution
   comes a file called README, which tells how to install and use Gri in
   an msdos context.
   
   Also, see the Gri manual under the heading [95]"Compilation on
   PC-style Computers" 
   
   As for viewing the output, I recommend obtaining a copy of the
   Ghostview program (which is a general PostScript display program), in
   the version called [96]GSview.
   
   [97]
   
  A6.6 Is there a linux version of Gri?
  
   For non-RedHat versions of linux, one compiles and installs Gri in the
   usual way; see [98]the manual for more details.
   
   Users of RedHat linux have it much easier though! A RPM (RedHat
   Program Manager) version of Gri exists, so that installing it takes
   just one line of typing, or one mouse-click in the RPM GUI-based
   installer called `glint'. requires just one line of typing (or
   
   The RPM (RedHat Package Manager) version exists at FTP site
   [99]ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri in a file with a name
   such as `gri-2.1.17-1.i386.rpm' (RedHat readers will know immediately
   what all the numbers and dots stand for!) Once you've downloaded this,
   install Gri by typing

    rpm -i gri-2.1.17-1.i386.rpm

   Later on, Gri may be uninstalled ('extracted') by typing
    rpm -e gri

   Knowledgeable RedHat users will know that RPM can also give
   information about Gri; for non-experts, here are a few examples:

    rpm -qa       --  list all installed packages
    rpm -qi gri   --  summarize gri capabilities (if it's installed)
    rpm -ql gri   --  list all files related to gri

A7 Gri bugs

   [100]
   
  A7.1 What are known bugs in Gri?
  
   Gri is used daily by many users, including the author, so that it
   suffers few serious bugs. Generally, more recent versions of Gri
   suffer fewer bugs than earlier versions. This improvement owes much to
   the trial of daily usage by folks with differing working styles; and
   all users can thank those who send in bug reports (see [101]Q7.2).
   
   One of the main problems with recent versions of Gri is that line
   numbers of syntax errors are reported inaccurately, if the error
   occured inside a new-command.
   
   A list of Gri bugs is maintained in the [102]full manual.
   
   [103]
   
  A7.2 How can I report Gri bugs?
  
   The first step is to make sure it is actually a bug. You might try,
   for example, posting a question to the Gri newsgroup (see [104]Q2.3),
   and getting advice from other users. Please be clear, so you don't
   waste others users' time. If you think you've found a bug, let the
   author know. Here's the advice from the manual (see especially item 4,
   for directions on emailing bug reports):
   
   Your bug reports help make Gri reliable and useful. Reporting bugs
   often results in quick changes to gri which will solve your problem.
   This is especially true if your version is reasonably up-to-date, for
   then you can simply get the corrected version and replace the version
   you were using. Here is how to report bugs:
     * 1. Determine the version number of your copy of Gri by running Gri
       as

  gri -v

and noting the number that is printed out.

   2. Prepare a command-file that illustrates your bug. Please pare
down the command-file to the *smallest* bit that causes the bug to
surface.

   3. It may be helpful to enclose the PostScript output file also,
if you need to tell me about aspects of the plot.  (This is because
the version of Gri I'm using might not give the badness on the page,
so I'd have no way to know what you were talking about!.)

   4. Email me
([105]Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca) a description
of the bug, along with the enclosed command file and any necessary
data files.  Minimally, then, I'll need a README file that describes
the problem, and a gri commandfile that exercises the bug.  On a unix
machine, here is how you can the whole package to me:

  tar -cvhf - ... | compress -c | uuencode a.gz | mail Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca

where you replace ... by a list of the files you want to send.
