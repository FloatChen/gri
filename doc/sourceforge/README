Updating the tab images:

Warning: This is slow, and should be automated!


1) Modify tabs.gri file until it's ok.

2) In shell, type
	gri tabs.gri > ~/tmp
   and then edit the results stored into ~/tmp into the
   subroutines.php file, at the obvious place.

3) Split the pages of tabs.ps into individual pages named
   main.ps, etc. (named by the tab names).  I use gv to
   do this.

4) In shell, type
	make
   to create .png files.

5) If you are Dan Kelley, in the shell type
	make install
   to install the files.  Otherwise, examine INSTALL 
   to see how this is done, using scp.
