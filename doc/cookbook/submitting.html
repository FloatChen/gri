<title>Submitting Recipes to Gri Cookbook</title>

To submit something for inclusion in the cookbook, follow these steps.

<ul>

<li> Make sure your program works on a recent version of Gri.
     
<li> Collect your Gri commandfile and all necessary datafiles in one
directory.

<li> Write a short file called <code>README</code>, in which you fill
in the blanks under these headings:

<ul>

<li> <strong> Author(s)</strong>

<li> <strong> Date</strong>

<li> <strong> Version of Gri used</strong>

<li> <strong> Uses color?</strong>

<li> <strong> Comments</strong> (optional)

<li> <strong> Index Entries</strong> (optional)

</ul>

I'll collate this information into a terse paragraph
introducing the example.

<li> Collect these files using the <code>tar</code> program, and then
compress them, e.g. for a program called <code>foo</code> with
datafiles <code>foo1.dat</code> and <code>foo2.dat</code>, do this:

<pre>
tar -chof eg.tar foo.gri foo1.dat foo2.dat README
gzip eg.tar
</pre>

<li> Put the files in your anonymous FTP area, if you have one, or
translate them into an ascii file by typing <code> uuencode eg
eg.tar.gz </code> and storing this file so that you can email it to
other users.

<li> Inform the Gri users of your contribution by mailing a message to
<code> gri@open.dal.ca</code> with subject line <code>Cookbook
contribution</code}.  (The subject line will thus let uninterested
users know to delete the message without reading it.)  In your
message, indicate the SITE:DIRECTORY of the file in your FTP area, or
indicate your intention to mail the <code>uuencoded</code> version to
anybody who asks.

</ul>

I'll add examples to the cookbook only if another Gri user nominates
the example for inclusion.  They may do so by mailing a nomination to
<code>gri@open.dal.ca</code> with subject line <code>Cookbook
contribution</code>.

<p> If other Gri users support your proposal to include the example,
then I'll add it to the cookbook.  I will do only minimal editing of
the commandfile: (1) I'll add a ``contributed by'' comment to the
commandfile, (2) reformat it in a uniform style, and (3) email the
result back to the author for final testing.

<p> As editor, I will be collating these files, not checking them or
supporting them.  Similarly, contributers will not be expected to
support their code; otherwise I doubt that anybody will contribute.
