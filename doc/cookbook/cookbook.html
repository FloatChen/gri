<h1>A Cookbook of Gri Recipes</h1>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1> This cookbook shows how people use Gri.  No
explanations of the code are given, beyond comments in the command
files.  For detailed information on Gri see the <a
href="http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/~kelley/gri/gri1.html">world-wide-web
manual</a> at :

<p>
<code>
http://www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri/gri1.html
</code>

<p>
or the PostScript and GNUinfo versions at the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri">FTP site</a>

<p>
<code>
ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri
</code>

<p>
At Dalhousie University, the Physical Oceanography and Atmospheric
Science system has the manuals online; just type <code>info gri</code>
(info version), or consult the PostScript file
<code>~kelley/src/gri/doc/gri.ps</code> (postscript version).

<p>


<h1>2. Accessing the Cookbook Online</h1> This cookbook is stored in
PostScript at
<code>~ftp/pub/receive/kelley/gri/cookbook/all_pages.ps</code> (a
PostScript version available to <code>open,cs,atm,...</code> Dalhousie
users) and at the anonymous FTP site
<code>ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca</code> in the directory
<code>pub/receive/kelley/gri/cookbook</code>.  It contains files with
names like <code>all_pages.ps.gz example1.gri example2.gri </code>.

<p>

The file <code>all_pages.ps.gz</code> is the complete cookbook, in
PostScript format, compressed with the <code>gzip</code> command.  (If
your machine lacks <code>gzip</code>, ask your system manager to get
it).  The other files are the command files from the cookbook.  Note
that the commandfiles do not have the necessary datafiles present,
since that is too cumbersome (for me and for the contributors, who
would have to make substantial changes to their commandfiles).

<p>
<p>

There are other interesting files in the directory above the cookbook
directory, e.g. a full manual for Gri, two reference cards, a FAQ
document, a diary of messages posted to the Gri mailgroup (see the FAQ
for how to join the group), a suite of working examples, etc.  Please
browse.



<h1>3. Submitting recipes</h1>
To submit something for inclusion in the cookbook, follow these steps.
<ul>

<li> Make sure your program works on a recent version of Gri.
     
<li> Collect your Gri commandfile and all necessary datafiles in one
directory.

<li> Write a short file called <code>README</code>, in which you fill
in the blanks under these headings:

<ul>

<li> <strong> Author(s)</strong>

<li> <strong> Date</strong>

<li> <strong> Version of Gri used</strong>

<li> <strong> Uses color?</strong>

<li> <strong> Comments</strong> (optional)

<li> <strong> Index Entries</strong> (optional)

</ul>

I'll collate this information into a terse paragraph
introducing the example.

<li> Collect these files using the <code>tar</code> program, and then
compress them, e.g. for a program called <code>foo</code> with
datafiles <code>foo1.dat</code> and <code>foo2.dat</code>, do this:

<pre>
tar -chof eg.tar foo.gri foo1.dat foo2.dat README
gzip eg.tar
</pre>

<li> Put the files in your anonymous FTP area, if you have one, or
translate them into an ascii file by typing <code> uuencode eg
eg.tar.gz </code> and storing this file so that you can email it to
other users.

<li> Inform the Gri users of your contribution by mailing a message to
<code> gri@open.dal.ca</code> with subject line <code>Cookbook
contribution</code}.  (The subject line will thus let uninterested
users know to delete the message without reading it.)  In your
message, indicate the SITE:DIRECTORY of the file in your FTP area, or
indicate your intention to mail the <code>uuencoded</code> version to
anybody who asks.

</ul>

I'll add examples to the cookbook only if another Gri user nominates
the example for inclusion.  They may do so by mailing a nomination to
<code>gri@open.dal.ca</code> with subject line <code>Cookbook
contribution</code>.

<p> If other Gri users support your proposal to include the example,
then I'll add it to the cookbook.  I will do only minimal editing of
the commandfile: (1) I'll add a ``contributed by'' comment to the
commandfile, (2) reformat it in a uniform style, and (3) email the
result back to the author for final testing.

<p> As editor, I will be collating these files, not checking them or
supporting them.  Similarly, contributers will not be expected to
support their code; otherwise I doubt that anybody will contribute.
