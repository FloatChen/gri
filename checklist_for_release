INSTRUCTIONS.
  This file is maintained in the Gri development CVS branch, but is
  not part of the Gri source.  The developers update this file
  individually, on their local machines, as tasks are done.  At each
  stage, they do a "cvs update" to let the other developers know of
  progress, and then update the SourceForge site by a shell command
  of the following forms:

 scp checklist_for_release dankelley@gri.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/g/gr/gri/htdocs
 scp checklist_for_release psg@gri.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/g/gr/gri/htdocs


CODING OF CHECKLIST.
  A "+" beside an item means that it has been done.
  A "-" beside an item means that it has NOT been done yet.

CHECKLIST.
  1+ DEK and PSG agree to freeze the code and the documentation.

  2+ DEK does a redhat build with the version on CVS, fixing any
     problems and letting PSG know when the build is clean.

  3+ PSG does a debian build with the version on CVS.  If there are any
     problems, return to step 2.

  4+ When it builds on redhat and debian, DEK "tags" this particular
     state of the code by using a cvs command such as e.g.
	  cvs tag -F "GRI_2_6_1"
     for the 2.6.1 version.

  5+ DEK creates an official tarball and uploads it to the SourceForge
     website (SF henceforth).

  6+ DEK builds an official redhat package based on the official
     tarball.  If any problems, back to step 2.

  7+ PSG builds an official Debian package based on the official
     tarball.  If any problems, back to step 2.

  8+ DEK uploads the official redhat package to SF.

  9+ PSG uploads unofficial Debian package to SF, and official Debian
     packages (built for `unstable`) to Debian.

  10+ DEK edits the SF webpage to indicate that a new version has
      been released.

  11+ DEK updates the HTML docs on SF.

  12+ DEK updates the PDF docs on SF.

  13- DEK builds a solaris version and installs it on SF.
