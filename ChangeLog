	* VERSION 2.4.4
	
	* Make it report a warning, rather than an error, if mathematical
	operations are tried on empty columns (e.g. 'y += 10').
 
	* The Makefile doesn't automatically link to the math library;
	instead it uses "./configure" to figure out whether a math
	library exists.  This is because BeOS doesn't use the math
	library.

	* Some other changes to Makefile, which I think/hope affect
	only "make install", not "make install_linux_debian" or
	"make install_linux_redhat".

	* I no longer use "popen()" subroutine, which BeOS does not
	have, unless I REALLY need it.  (utility.cc)

	* Clean up a few things in the configure script, mainly by
	renaming variables to be more readible, and by removing tests for
	architectures that never have any affect on the code.
