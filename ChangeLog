	* startup.cc (interpret_optional_arguments): examine the
	commandline argument "-output NNN" for various file types,
	e.g. GIF and SVG files, but (so far) only actually _handle_
	postscript file types.  I think SVG output would be nice, since I
	think that's where free vector-graphics editors are going.
 
2001-10-14  Dan E. Kelley  <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>

	* variable.cc (put_var): update the _xinc and _yinc values, if the
	variables named ..xinc.. or ..yinc.. get modified

	* scales.cc (create_y_scale): keep ..xinc.. and ..yinc.. up to
	date as scales are changed

	* startup.cc (set_defaults): store ..xinc.. and ..yinc..

	* doc/gri.texim: update the history sections to account for
	versions 2.8.3 and 2.8.4

	* startup.redhat: rewrite to shorten and clarify; also, put in a
	pointer to the SourceForge website.

2001-10-13  Dan E. Kelley  <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>

	* startup.cc (start_up): prevent segfault if no command-file name
	is supplied

	* set.cc (set_line_widthCmd): make 'set line width rapidograph'
	(that is, with no pen-width name) give a more informative error

	* utility.cc (show_words): this will help in debugging

2001-10-09  Dan E. Kelley  <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>

	* Makefile.in (check): add 'make check', to run the 'check.pl'
	Perlscript (see next item)

	* check.pl: add this new feature, which checks version numbers in
	the various files, and will (I hope) eventually check other
	aspects of a release.

2001-10-01 Dan Kelley <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>
	
	* Release as gri-2.8.4 on SourceForge.Net site.  
	
	* Fix SourceForge bug #467973 (`gri -version' gave wrong version
	number, breaking the Emacs Gri mode.)
	
	* Fix SourceForge bug #468401 (`draw grid' disobeys pencolor)
	
	
2001-10-01 Dan Kelley <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>
	
	* Release as gri-2.8.3 on SourceForge.Net site.  
	
	* Fix SourceForge bug #462243 (endian problem in Rasterfile
	images, plus a reading problem in PGM images).

2001-09-10 Dan Kelley <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>
	
	* Release as gri-2.8.2 on SourceForge.Net site.
	
	* Really fix SourceForge bug #454557 (wouldn't compile with the
	pre-release version 3.0.1 of the GNU c++ compiler).  This closes
	SourceForge Bug #111093.

2001-09-06 Dan Kelley <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>

	* Release as gri-2.8.1 on SourceForge.Net site.
	
	* Fix SourceForge bug #450465 (`create columns from function' was
	broken).
	
	* Fix SourceForge bug #454557 (wouldn't compile with the
	pre-release version 3.0.1 of the GNU c++ compiler). Closes
	Sourceforge bug #111093)
	
2001-07-24 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* Bump up version number to 2.8.0

2001-07-23 Dan Kelley <Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca>

	* Release as gri-2.8.0 on SourceForge.Net site.

	* Add `unlink' command as a unix-familiar way to delete files.

	* Add `set page size' command to clip to a given page size.

	* Add `substr' RPN operator to permit extraction of sub-strings.

	* Add `default' for the `set x name' and the `set y name'
	commands.

	* Add Perl-like ability to put underscores in numerical constants
	(`.v. = 1_000' and `.v. = 1000' are completely equivalent).

	* In Emacs mode, change <M-Tab> so that it completes builtin
	variables and synonyms as well as commands.

	* In Emacs mode, add "idle-timer help" to display defaults for
	builtin variables under cursor.

	* In Emacs mode, make fontification of builtin variables apply
	only if spelled correctly.

	* To Makefile, add `make source-arch-indep' target in sources.
	This will build a source tar file in which all the
	architecture-independent material (documentation in HTML,
	postscript and Info formats) is pre-made.  This makes it easier to
	install gri on a host that doesn't have TeX and ImageMagick
	installed.

	* Move gri-html-doc and gri-ps-doc documentation files to the
	/usr/share/doc/gri directory

	* Ensure that package compiles with Standards-Version: 3.5.5
	without changes.

2001-04-19 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* Rename the RPM spec file as gri.spec, without the version number
	embedded in the filename.  Upgrade to version number 2.6.1.
	Change url to point to sourceforge site (but leave ftp as it is,
	for now anyway).

2000-06-1 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* Triv changes here; code changes are to read compressed files,
	and manual improvements.

2000-05-30  Peter S. Galbraith <psg@debian.org>

	* doc/gri.texi: Added Emacs gri-mode chapter.
	
	* doc/gri.texi: Example images are not in example directory
	anymore.

	* doc/screenshots: new directory.

	* doc/gri2html: Colorize .gri file in HTML manual.

	* index.html: Now first page instead of gri1.html

	* doc/HTML_subdivide: Now has better navigation tags.

	* doc/examples: All examples are jpg instead of Gif.

	* doc/texinfo2HTML: skips a few more @if constructs.

	* doc/Makefile: Updated for above things.

	* Makefile.in: Updated source target
	
2000-05-12 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>
	
	* Compress info files for linux-redhat.

2000-05-11 Peter S Galbraith <psg@debian.org>

	* Change info files to .info file extension.
	
	* Tweaked install-info rules.  I hope they work.

	* Patch texinfo2HTML to skip over the @dircategory line and
	  the @direntry block.
	
	* Uncomment them in gri.texi
	
	* Make gri.texi produce .info extensions (@setfilename gri.info)
	
	* Patch gri-2.5.1.spec, Makefile.in and doc/Makefile targets to
	  use .info extension.

2000-05-07  Dan E. Kelley  <kelley@Intrusion.Phys.Ocean.Dal.Ca>

	* VERSION 2.4.4
	
	* Make it report a warning, rather than an error, if mathematical
	operations are tried on empty columns (e.g. 'y += 10').
 
	* The Makefile doesn't automatically link to the math library;
	instead it uses "./configure" to figure out whether a math
	library exists.  This is because BeOS doesn't use the math
	library.

	* Some other changes to Makefile, which I think/hope affect
	only "make install", not "make install_linux_debian" or
	"make install_linux_redhat".

	* I no longer use "popen()" subroutine, which BeOS does not
	have, unless I REALLY need it.  (utility.cc)

	* Clean up a few things in the configure script, mainly by
	renaming variables to be more readible, and by removing tests for
	architectures that never have any affect on the code.

2000-04-01 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* Fix spec-file error in the install-info command.  However, to my
	great frustration, this is still broken or install-info is broken)
	since the command doesn't install an entry for gri.  After
	hand-editing to insert a Gri entry, I uncovered another bug, and
	so I have added a chmod of /usr/info/dir file so folks other than
	root can use info.
	
	* Update the version number in gri.cmd to match the number
	compiled into gri.  

	* Update the startup message from the old form to the new form.

	* Call this release 3 to match Tim Powers' convention (although I
	think it should be called release 1, when it works!)

2000-03-31 Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* applied Tim Powers' patches directly to the sources, updating
	them so that the patches Tim had made in this spec file are no
	longer needed.  Note: I didn't apply Tim's patch to the
	documentation, since visual inspection indicated that I had
	already repaired the errors he found (each of which which involved
	my having used an incorrect name for the example gif files.)

	* renamed Tim's spec file from gri.spec to gri-2.4.3.spec since
	otherwise I'd get too confused as versions develop.

2000-01-30  Dan Kelley <dan.kelley@dal.ca>

	* Changing to e.g. /usr/share/info instead of /usr/info.  Same for
	manpages.  I know, I should be using the fancy macros that are
	defined in /usr/lib/rpm, but these seemed contradictory, with
	respect to where things are in my Redhat 7.0 setup ... and I had a
	hard time figuring out how to use these macros anyway, so I just
	gave up and hard-wired them in, using the new directories as used
	in Redhat 7.0, as opposed to the (different) directories in all
	the other Redhat versions I've had.  Someday I'll switch to using
	macros, but it means changing both this spec-file and various
	Makefiles, and I need to be sure that changes to the Makefiles
	don't hurt the distributions for Debian linux, for solaris, etc.
