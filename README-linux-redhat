What Gri is
===========

Gri is a programming language for scientific graphics.  It can make
x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In addition, Gri has a
full suite of low-level graphical elements and sufficient programming
capabilities (loops, subroutines, etc) to permit complex
customization.

Gri is not point-click.  In some ways it is analogous to TeX.
Extensive power rewards tolerance of a modest learning curve.


Obtaining Gri for RedHat
========================

Normally, you'll want to download the redhat package

    ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri/gri-2.1.18-1.i386.rpm

and install it with RPM, e.g. by the command

    rpm -U gri-2.1.18-1.i386.rpm

At present no rpm package is available for the source.  The source is
only available as a gzipped tarfile, as

    ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/kelley/gri/gri-2.1.18.tgz

The package provides a cursory manpage, available by typing

    man gri

at the unix prompt.  The manpage is very cursory.  More useful
information is available in INFO format, available by typing

    info gri

at the unix prompt, or through access by emacs.  More useful still is
the HTML version of the documentation, available at the local URL

    /opt/gri/doc/html/gri1.html
