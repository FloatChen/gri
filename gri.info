WHAT GRI IS

Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. The word
"language" is important: Gri is command-driven, not point/click.

Some users consider Gri similar to LaTeX, since both provide extensive
power as a reward for tolerating a learning curve.

Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image graphs, in
PostScript and (someday) SVG formats. Control is provided over all
aspects of drawing, e.g. line widths, colors, and fonts. A TeX-like
syntax provides common mathematical symbols.

STARTING TO USE GRI

Folks who write thousand-line Gri scripts usually start with something
as simple as the following, which produces an auto-scaled graph.

   open file.dat
   read columns x y
   draw curve
