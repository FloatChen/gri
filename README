What Gri is
===========

 Gri is a language for scientific graphics applications.  By 'language'
 I mean that it is a command-driven application, as opposed to a
 click/point application.  It is analogous to latex or tex, and shares
 the property that extensive power is the reward for tolerating a
 modest learning curve.  Gri output is in industry-standard PostScript,
 suitable for incorporation in documents prepared by various text
 processors.

 Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
 addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
 capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
 Precise control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
 line-widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
 language, so that it is easy to incorporate Greek letters and
 mathematical symbols in labels.


Compiling and Installing Gri
============================
 
  1) Uncompress and then untar the file, by typing:

	 gunzip gri-2.2.0.tgz
	 tar xvf gri-2.2.0.tar

     The version number 2.2.0 has been used for example in the above.


  2) Compile gri and prepare the manuals by typing:

	 make all

     You'll need:

       C++ compiler for compiling gri
       netcdf libraries (if you want to be able to read netCDF files)
       tex, texinfo, imagemagick, info, gs and its fonts to build the manual.

  3) Install gri and the manuals, by typing:

	 make install
