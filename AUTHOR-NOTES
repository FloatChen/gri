Gri release procedure
=====================

The list below is the typical procedure leading up to a release, where
"DEK" is the primary author, and "PSG" is the debian packager.

1. DEK fixes a bug or adds a feature, and then indicates this by
   updating ``configure.ac`` and ``doc/gri.texi``.  (The latter file
   needs updating both near the top, where the new and old versions
   are numbered explicitly, and also at the History section.).  Then
   he does a ``git-push``, and asks PSG to ``git-pull`` it.

2. PSG updates various debian files, does a ``git-push``, and asks DEK
   to do a ``git-pull``.

3. DEK verifies that the build works.  Then he makes a tarball and
   sends it to PSG for testing.

4. PSG tests it.  Steps 1--3 are repeated if there is a problem,
   otherwise he tells DEK that the tarball is OK.

5. DEK uploads the tarball to SourceForge and makes the release.

6. PSG does the debian release.
