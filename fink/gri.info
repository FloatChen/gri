DescDetail: <<
Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. The word "language" is 
important: Gri is command-driven, not point/click.

Some users consider Gri similar to LaTeX, since both provide extensive power 
as a reward for tolerating a learning curve.

Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image graphs, in PostScript 
and (someday) SVG formats. Control is provided over all aspects of drawing,
e.g. line widths, colors, and fonts. A TeX-like syntax provides common
mathematical symbols.

Folks who write thousand-line Gri scripts usually start with something 
as simple as the following, which produces an auto-scaled graph.

   open file.dat
   read columns x y
