Steps to building the fink package.  (For reference, search on "fink packaging tutorial".)

1. Adjust gri.info if the version number has been increased.  Run
	fink validate gri.info
   to find errors.  Fix these before proceeding.

2. Put the local copy of gri.info into a special place
	sudo cp gri.info /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/

3. Download the gri source
	fink fetch gri

4. Build it
	fink build gri

5. Install it
	fink install gri
